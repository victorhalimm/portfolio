description: "Miserease is a social web app built to give people a place to share their struggles and receive support from others. It’s all about promoting empathy and offering a sense of closure—users can post their stories, get encouraging feedback, and even update with positive resolutions. Developed as a submission for the GarudaHacks hackathon, this project was created by a team of four, including me, Ryan Rafael, Reynaldo Vinsen, and Steven."
